# PyRockDiff - Automatic change-detection workflow for rockfall identification

### üöÄ Quick Overview
This Python-based pipeline automates the comparison of two point clouds obtained from LiDAR or SfM, specifically targeting rock surfaces. It allows for efficient analysis of geological changes with minimal user input.

Key features include:

- **Automation:** The pipeline operates automatically, requiring only a single configuration file for setup.
- **User-Friendly Configuration:** Simplifies the process, making advanced analysis accessible without programming knowledge.
- **Preprocessing:** Cleans point clouds by removing noise and vegetation and aligns them accurately using registration algorithms.
- **Change Detection:** Detects differences between the two analyzed epochs with the M3C2 algorithm.
- **Clustering & Volume Calculation:** Isolates changes using DBSCAN and estimates volumes via alpha-shape triangulation.

## Overview

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

<br>

This project is a Python-based pipeline designed to automate the comparison of two point clouds obtained from LiDAR or Structure from Motion (SfM), specifically focusing on rock surfaces. The pipeline begins with essential pre-processing steps, including data cleaning and vegetation removal, to prepare the data for analysis. It then employs algorithms for Fast Global Registration and Iterative Closest Point (ICP) alignment, enabling precise change detection results.

The software identifies differences between the two epochs using the M3C2 algorithm, isolates clusters using the DBSCAN algorithm, and calculates the volumes of detected changes through alpha-shape triangulation. It is designed for automation and user-friendliness, making it accessible to non-experts in coding while efficiently processing large datasets. The libraries and software used are open-source, enhancing accessibility and collaboration.

## How It Works

This section provides a basic overview of how the code operates, what inputs are expected, and how the execution flow is controlled.

<details>
<summary>Basic Functionality</summary>

### Basic Functionality
The code is designed to automate a sequence of point cloud processing tasks, including filtering, registration, clustering, and volume computation. Each step is modular and can be executed depending on the options selected.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Input Data</summary>

### Input Data
The code expects specific input data formats:
- Point clouds (e.g., `.ply`, `.las`)
- Pre-defined parameters and paths provided through a configuration `.JSON` file.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Configuration JSON File</summary>

### Configuration JSON File
All options, paths, and parameters for the execution are controlled through a configuration file located in the `json_files` folder. This file allows the user to toggle various processing steps and fine-tune parameters without modifying the code.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Code Structure</summary>

### Code Structure
The code follows a sequential execution pattern, but it is flexible. You can start from any step in the workflow, provided the necessary files from earlier steps are supplied as inputs. This modular approach allows skipping steps that have been completed previously or executing the entire workflow from start to finish.
